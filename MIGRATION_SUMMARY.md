# Prisma Migration Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the Prisma migrations performed on the Acronis Key Validator project to improve database performance and maintain schema consistency.

## Migrations Performed

### 1. Database Reset and Re-application of Existing Migrations

- **Date**: September 16, 2025
- **Purpose**: Resolve migration inconsistencies and ensure clean database state
- **Actions**:
  - Reset the MySQL database
  - Re-applied all existing migrations:
    - `20250830052605_init`
    - `20250901064228_make_reseller_hodate_nullable`
    - `20250916100000_add_logs_table`
    - `20250916110000_modify_logs_admin_id_nullable`

### 2. Addition of Index on Credentials Code Field

- **Migration Name**: `20250916095328_add_code_index_to_credentials`
- **Purpose**: Improve performance of QR code validation queries
- **Changes**:
  - Added index `code_index` on the `code` column of the `credentials` table
  - This index will significantly speed up queries that search for credentials by their QR code value

## Database Schema Status

- **Current State**: Database schema is in sync with Prisma schema
- **Verification**: Confirmed using `npx prisma migrate status` and `npx prisma migrate diff`
- **Index Verification**: Confirmed that the `code_index` exists on the `credentials` table

## Performance Impact

The addition of the index on the credentials code field will provide the following benefits:

1. **Faster QR Code Validation**: Queries that search for credentials by their QR code value will execute much faster
2. **Improved User Experience**: Reduced latency when validating QR codes in the application
3. **Better Scalability**: As the number of credentials grows, query performance will remain consistent

## Next Steps

1. Monitor application performance to verify the impact of the new index
2. Consider adding additional indexes if other query patterns are identified as performance bottlenecks
3. Regularly review and optimize database schema as the application evolves

## Commands for Future Reference

- **Check migration status**: `npx prisma migrate status`
- **Generate Prisma client**: `npx prisma generate`
- **Create new migration**: `npx prisma migrate dev --name migration_name`
- **Reset database**: `npx prisma migrate reset`
