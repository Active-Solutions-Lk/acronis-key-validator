// Simple test script to verify the logs table works with Prisma
// This script can be run directly with Node.js to test basic functionality

// console.log('This is a placeholder script to verify the logger implementation.');
// console.log('To properly test the logger, you can:');
// console.log('1. Check that the logs table was created in the database');
// console.log('2. Try creating a credential through the API and verify a log entry is created');
// console.log('3. Check the logs in the admin dashboard');

// Note: We can't easily test the Prisma functionality here because of module resolution issues
// The actual testing should be done through the application itself by:
// 1. Creating a new reseller or credential
// 2. Checking that log entries are created in the database
// 3. Viewing the logs in the admin dashboard
